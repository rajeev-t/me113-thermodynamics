Consider an electrically heated home. The dimensions of its roof are 6m long, 8 m wide, and 0.25 m thick. The roof is made of concrete who thermal conductivity is 0.8 W/m-K. The temperature inside the house is kept at 25 C (for a period of 10 hours) where the outer temperature changes from 10 degrees to 0 degrees (assume in a step of 1 degree during the night). Plot the rate of heat loss through the roof that night as a function of the outer temperature. Additionally assume now that the outer temperature remains constant at 5 degrees Centigrade during the night. In that case find the cost of the heat loss to the home owner if the cost of electricity is $0.08/kWh. Analyze and give comments on your results.
