# Project 1 Report

## Overview

There is an electrically heated home, and the parameters that affect it are as following:

</p>

The project involves:
1. Plotting the rate of heat loss( **Q̇** ) through the roof(*depicted in purple*) as a function of the outside temperature( **10°C - 0°C** )

2. Assuming the outside temperature remains constant at **5°C**, calulcating the cost of heat loss, given that electricity is **$0.08/kWh**

## Setup & Calculations

1. The equation for the *rate* of heat loss through the roof is given by:

    $$
        Q̇ = \frac{k·A·ΔT}{L}
    $$

    where,
    * *k* is the thermal conductivity of the roof's material, concrete
    * *A* is the cross-sectional area of the roof
    * *ΔT* is the difference between:
        * Temperature at the inner face of the roof( **25°C** ), and 
        * Temperature at the outer face of the roof( outside temperature ) 
    * *L* is the length between the temperature points

    So, let's plug in the values:

2. Instead of varying from **10°C** to **0°C**, the outside temperature is at a constant **5°C**. And the given cost of heat is **$0.08/kWh**.

    So, let's plug in the values, once again:
